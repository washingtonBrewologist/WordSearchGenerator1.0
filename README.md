# WordSearchGenerator
This program will allow a user to generate a word search by either entering the words manually, or by having the words read in from a file. 

[ Program notes ]

If you are reading words in from a file, make sure that each word is on its own line.

Once a word search has been generated, a solution to the puzzle is availale by selecting 's' from the main menu. Likewise, if a puzzle is saved to a file, a solution will be included in the file.

Here's what the persistant user menu looks like :

------------[ User Menu ]-----------

	Generate a new word search:   ( g )
	Print out your word search:   ( p )
	Show the solution:            ( s )
	Save generated puzzle:        ( sf )
	Quit the program:             ( q )

	Enter Selection:
