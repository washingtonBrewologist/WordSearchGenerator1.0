# WordSearchGenerator
This program will allow a user to generate a word search by either entering the words manually, or by having the words read in from a file. 

[ Program notes ]

If you are reading words in from a file, make sure that each word is on its own line.

Once a word search has been generated, a solution to the puzzle is availale by selecting 's' from the main menu. Likewise, if a puzzle is saved to a file, a solution will be included in the file.
